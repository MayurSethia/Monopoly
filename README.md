# Monopoly Simulation

This is a simple C++-based board game simulation. It demonstrates how to implement basic game mechanics such as clearing the screen, simulating turns, and waiting for user input. The game is structured to simulate a turn-based interaction between two players, showcasing platform-independent techniques for screen clearing and input handling.

## Features

- **Turn-Based Simulation**: Players take turns in the game, with delays to simulate the flow of the game.
- **Input Handling**: The game waits for the user to press the Enter key before proceeding to the next turn.
